# SAGUI platform

SAGUI is an early warning prototype designed for French Guyana.

The project's code base is hosted on https://github.com/HydroMetGuyane-Hydro-Matters.

The platform is visible on http://sagui.hydro-matters.fr/sagui/

It makes use of the [HYFAA - MGB model](https://github.com/OMP-IRD/hyfaa-scheduler) to compute and predict rivers' flow and height, based on satellite data.
